# agent-glance

> ⚠️ **WIP — Work in Progress.** This package is under active development. Expect breaking changes, rough edges, and bugs. Not production-ready. Pin a specific version if you depend on it, and please file issues for anything you hit.

An MCP server that provides a shared HUD — the **glance** — across AI agent sessions. Multiple clients (Claude Code sessions, Codex, etc.) attach to one running server instead of spawning one per client, so every session sees and can update the same on-screen surface.

## Requirements

- **macOS** (the HUD and menu-bar status item are macOS-only for now)
- **Node.js 18+**

## Install

Run the installer — it delegates to [`add-mcp`](https://github.com/neondatabase/add-mcp)
so you can choose supported clients interactively:

```bash
npx agent-glance install
```

For non-interactive global installation to all supported agents:

```bash
npx agent-glance install -y --all
```

Once added, restart your agent. The first tool call spawns the daemon; subsequent sessions attach to the same daemon and share the HUD.

## Usage

Inside any connected session, ask the agent to use one of the glance tools:

- *"Write to the glance: `# Build status\n✅ Tests passing`"* → calls `write_glance`
- *"Hide the glance HUD."* → calls `hide_glance`
- *"Read the current glance buffer."* → calls `read_glance`
- *"Edit the glance: replace `failing` with `passing`."* → calls `edit_glance` (requires a prior `read_glance` in the same session)

The HUD anchor (top-right / top-left / bottom-right / bottom-left / follow-cursor / hide) is controlled from the macOS menu-bar status item that appears when the daemon starts.

## Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dyingg/agent-glance.git
cd agent-glance
npm install
npm run build
npm link
claude mcp add agent-glance -- agent-glance
```

## How it works

```
Client #1 ──stdio──▶ adapter ─┐
Client #2 ──stdio──▶ adapter ─┼──▶ Unix socket ──▶ daemon  (one process)
Codex     ──stdio──▶ adapter ─┘
```

`agent-glance` uses a **singleton daemon + stdio adapter** pattern. One compiled binary plays two roles, dispatched by the `AGENT_GLANCE_ROLE` env var: unset → adapter (what the MCP client launches), `daemon` → the long-running server the adapter spawns on first use. The daemon owns the glance window state and uses `bind()` on its socket path as its lock, so simultaneous adapter launches cannot produce two daemons.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `write_glance` | Replace the glance HUD contents with a new body (markdown/text). |
| `hide_glance` | Hide the glance window without clearing its buffer. |
| `read_glance` | Read back the current glance buffer (used as a gate before editing). |
| `edit_glance` | Apply an Edit-style string-replace patch to the glance buffer (read-before-edit enforced). |

## Development

```bash
npm run build      # tsc → dist/
npm test           # vitest run
npm run test:watch
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_GLANCE_SOCKET` | platform-specific | Socket/pipe path |
| `AGENT_GLANCE_PIDFILE` | next to socket | Pidfile written on daemon bind |
| `AGENT_GLANCE_IDLE_MS` | `30000` | Ms after last client disconnect before daemon exits |
| `AGENT_GLANCE_ROLE` | unset | Set to `daemon` to run as daemon (internal) |
| `AGENT_GLANCE_HUD_MODE` | unset | Glance HUD lifecycle mode |
| `AGENT_GLANCE_HUD_DISABLED` | unset | Disable the glance HUD entirely |
| `AGENT_GLANCE_STATUS_DISABLED` | unset | Disable the menu-bar status item |
| `AGENT_GLANCE_CONFIG` | platform-specific | Config file path |
